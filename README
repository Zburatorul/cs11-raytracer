To compile & run do:

0)
Edit Makefile with the correct path of the Boost libraries.
(This step is unnecessary on most systems if Boost is installed *correctly*)

1)
make depend 

2)
make all

3)
Create a file scene.txt with the scenery description.
Then run:
make render

Default Output should be:
scene.ppm  - an (400x400) PNM image file with the rendered scene.
debug.log - the errors and messages log file.

3*)
If you have the "pnmtojpeg" utility, you can convert the PNM image to JPEG easily by
doing:
make jpeg

A file "img.jpg" with the scene will apear in the same folder.

4) To generate documentation about the source code with Doxygen, do:
make doc


5) Do this to get rid of the old object files.
make clean
